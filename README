# BabyMonitorSystem

#For IOT implementation (you can also view the video so as to see teh circuit the sensors the woking the test cases etc and a better understanding)

Sensor Requirements to build circuit
LM35 sensor 
PIR Sensor
GSM Sim900A module(built with Dual Band GSM/GPRS engine frequencies ranging 900/ 1800 MHz) 
MIC and LEDs and diodes
Arduino software package (IDE),etc
The connection of which sensor to which port number is described with the help of a circuit diagram and block diagram and test cases in the
IOT_Description docx for better understanding along with the description of the project and methodological framework and flowchart
After receiving alerting texts with the help of gs module whenever the sensors are triggered is when the second extention of the project which is
the android application comes into play

#For Android implementation  you can download the app from the apk generated here and install in both devices as you will be audio streamimng
from the child device to the parent device
the apk is : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gB9ojKHM2WYB3N-u0vrWE7s2cpAKnV2W/view?usp=drivesdk
           : https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_t2dhIHVMu-jMR83KQ35Je_pDmx3gJ4M

Or you can also clone the project in and build and run main activity in android studio
You can see the functioning

This is made keeping in mind the number of alerts one has received from the above system and parents are thinking of preventive steps and 
taking into account As we know taking temperature type varies with age and also with the fact if it is rectal or oral or armpit.As when babies 
are 0-3 months old only rectal reading is advised and hence further symptoms are taking into consideration before predicting if the child needs
home remedies or instant doctor care of nearby available hospitals with their contact information.Same prediction is made when we enter how many
time has the nappy wet message been received. Thirdly our baby cry feature to audio stream where it could be used as a parent device or a child 
device according to the convenience of the parents This is in addition extention of the baby monitor system which deals with preventive measures 
once gsm module starts alerting and notifying parents.
For flowchart and description further to enhance understanding the Desciption(iot+android) docx is also for elaboration
